  <p>
    A page like this can use nifty logic tools to organize things into old
    assignments (things whose due date has passed), upcoming assignments,
    and (more distant) future assignments. That would require something like
    a <code>cron</code> job that runs once or twice every day to keep that up
    to date.

  <h1 class="page-heading">Assignments</h1>

  <ul class="assignment-list">
    {% for assignment in site.assignments %}
      <li>
        Due on <span class="post-meta">{{ assignment.due-date | date: "%b %-d, %Y" }}</span>;
        posted on <span class="post-meta">{{ assignment.date | date: "%b %-d, %Y" }}</span>

        <h2>
          <a class="post-link" href="{{ assignment.url | prepend: site.baseurl }}">{{ assignment.title | escape }}</a>
