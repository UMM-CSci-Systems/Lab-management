We're going to be using the `bash` shell and shell scripting a _lot_ in this
course, so you'll really need to get up to speed on the basics of using the
command line. There are a ton of resources out there, and ultimately you'll
want to find what works for you. As a starting place, though, you might
go through a tutorial like
["Learn enough command line to be dangerous"](https://www.learnenough.com/command-line-tutorial).

We could include a bunch of other shell resources here, or have a page of
shell resources that this links to.

We could also add a due date to the front matter section at the top of the
Jekyll source for this page or, if we wanted to get really fancy, have something
like a week number in the front matter, and then have Jekyll compute the due
date from the week number and the start of the semester.
