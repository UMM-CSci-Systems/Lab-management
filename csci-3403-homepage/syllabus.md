We can create pages like this for particular purposes, like

* The syllabus
* Contact info
* Calendar
* Etc.

Because Jekyll supports some nifty logic-y bits we could also use this to
generate things like "Upcoming assignments", although we'd have to make sure
that the site got rebuilt at regular intervals (once or twice daily) with
something like a `cron` job.
