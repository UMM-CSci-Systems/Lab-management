We can use Jekyll for blogg-y kinds of things like announcements or assignments,
or we can use other tools like Moodle or Canvas or Google Classroom for that
sort of stuff and keep this just for the basic info (syllabus, etc.).

Check out the [Jekyll docs][jekyll-docs] for more info on how to get the most out of Jekyll. File all bugs/feature requests at [Jekyllâ€™s GitHub repo][jekyll-gh]. If you have questions, you can ask them on [Jekyll Talk][jekyll-talk].
