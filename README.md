# Lab-management

The goal is for this repo to bring together a collection of resources and documentation for managing labs for the Computer Science systems core course(s) at the University of Minnesota, Morris. Other folks are welcome to also make use of these resources if they find them useful, and we'd love suggestions, pull requests, and the like.

# List of labs

## C and memory management

The [C and memory management lab](https://github.com/UMM-CSci-Systems/C-Lab-Starter) introduces the use of arrays (and strings) in C, along with the allocation and freeing of memory. It uses [the CMockery test library](https://code.google.com/p/cmockery/) for unit testing, and `valgrind` to identify memory leaks.

## C system calls; traversing directories

The [Traversing Directories lab](https://github.com/UMM-CSci-Systems/Traversing-Directories-starter) introduces making system calls from C, with a focus on calls that allow one to traverse directories and examine the status of files. It (currently) uses shell testing tools and doesn't need any special tools, although `valgrind` can be used to identify memory leaks.

## Circuit design

The [Circuit Design lab](https://github.com/UMM-CSci-Systems/Circuit-design-lab) is a simple, ungraded, "in lab" experience with basic circuit design using the [Logisim program](http://www.cburch.com/logisim/index.html) for the design work.
