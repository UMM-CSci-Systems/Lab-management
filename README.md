# Lab-management

The goal is for this repo to bring together a collection of resources and documentation for managing labs for the Computer Science systems core course(s) at the University of Minnesota, Morris. Other folks are welcome to also make use of these resources if they find them useful, and we'd love suggestions, pull requests, and the like.

## C and memory management

The [C and memory management lab](https://github.com/UMM-CSci-Systems/C-Lab-Starter) introduces the use of arrays (and strings) in C, along with the allocation and freeing of memory. It uses [the CMockery test library](https://code.google.com/p/cmockery/) for unit testing, and `valgrind` to identify memory leaks.
